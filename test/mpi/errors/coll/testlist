# MPICH currently fails the bcastlength test because it needs to do more
# checking on the receive status, so for the 1.0.5 release, we are 
# commenting out this test.
# 3/20/2011.  Since this was commented out before 1.0.5 and we are now 
# at 1.4, it is clear that this should not be commented out again
#
# 2012-04-20 Commenting out again. r9686 disabled the functionality that detects
# this because it was broken when nonblocking collectives are used.  Darius has
# a plan for how to fix this, but it will take some effort to implement.  It
# would be better if the mpich test suite had an XFAIL type of feature, but
# we don't so commenting is what we are stuck with for now. [goodell@]
